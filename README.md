This is a classic Breakout-style arcade game developed using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball upward and break rows of colored bricks. Each brick color represents a different point value. The game features collision detection, a scoring system, and limited lives. When the player clears all bricks or loses all lives, a final message displays the outcome and the final score. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, game loop logic, and interactive graphics in Python.
